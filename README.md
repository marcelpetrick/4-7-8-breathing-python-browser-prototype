# 4-7-8-breathing-python-browser-prototype
4-7-8 breathing exercise as python/pygame/pyodide based implementation. Prototype for a new project.

Initially this was part of the [codingWithGpt](https://github.com/marcelpetrick/codingWithGPT/tree/master/pythonBrowserTest)-repo. The initial idea to wrap a pygame-based implementation with pygbag worked so far that a usable page was created - but the widget was not rendered probley, because pygame paints with SDL, which is not allowed in a browser.  
Alternative approach: using `pyodide` as `pygbag`-replacement.

## TODO
